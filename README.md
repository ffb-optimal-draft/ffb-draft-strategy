# "Winning Draft Strategy" : Fantasy Football and Cheat sheet for PPR Leagues

 ## Project Description
 Data Scientists using; pro-football-reference.com, webscraping data from football.fantasysports.yahoo.com, and yahoofantasy API, datasets to develop a machine learning model that will help to predict the players total season projections. 

 ## Project Goals
 - Create a fantasy football drafting strategy cheat sheet based off of historical NFL and fantasy league data.
 - Create a machine learning model that predicts the upcoming NFL FFL 2023 total season PPR points for Quarter Backs, Running Backs, Wide Recievers, Tight Ends.
 - Gather findings, draw conclusions and recommended next steps for Fantasy Football team owners.

 ## Questions to answer
 - What position should I draft this round?
