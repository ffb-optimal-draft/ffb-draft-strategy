# "Winning Draft Strategy" : Fantasy Football and Cheat sheet for PPR Leagues

 ## Project Description
 Data Scientists using; pro-football-reference.com, webscraping data from football.fantasysports.yahoo.com, and yahoofantasy API, datasets to develop a machine learning model that will help to predict the players total season projections. 

 ## Project Goals
 - Create a fantasy football drafting strategy cheat sheet based off of historical NFL and fantasy league data.
 - Create a machine learning model that predicts the upcoming NFL FFL 2023 total season PPR points for Quarter Backs, Running Backs, Wide Recievers, Tight Ends.
 - Gather findings, draw conclusions and recommended next steps for Fantasy Football team owners.

 ## Questions to answer
 - What position should I draft this round?
 - Is it better to draft a RB, WR, TE or should draft a QB next?

 ## Initial Thoughts and Hypothesis
 Initially, the data records the past 7 years of Real-Word NFL Statistics and captured over 200 fantasy league. This large dataset will help draw accurate predictions for season projections.


 ## Planning
 - Perform Data acquisition and Preparation
 - Analyze Data features and analyze sports trends and patterns. 
 - Establish baseline of model using baseline methods.

 ## Conclustions and Recommendations
 - Our model prredicted that the closing price for Apple stock will plateau and slowly increase into the next 20 years.
 - I find that the stock for Apple is volitile and our prediction is strong but not confident in our future predictions. 
 - I recommend deeper Machine Learning models for volitile markets, i.e. Tensor Flow.

 ## Next Steps
 - The next steps will be to forecast on a stationary model to help predict further trends.
